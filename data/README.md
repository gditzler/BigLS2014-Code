# About the Data

The data from the American Gut Project was collected from a subset of the BIOM and map file from biocore's American Gut [repo](https://github.com/biocore/American-Gut). We extracted only the `male` and `female` subjects from the [original biom file](https://github.com/biocore/American-Gut/tree/master/data/AG) and we isolate only the samples collected from the subjects guts. The Caporaso obtained directly from the [Earth Microbiome Project](www.earthmicrobiome.org). We isolated the gut samples.
